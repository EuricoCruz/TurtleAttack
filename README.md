# TurtleAttack

The game turtle Attack is based on an ideia tha starts witth a turttle, in this case we use the pokemon Squirtle to illustrate it, 
to collect the trash and the uselles plastic and avoid it to stay in the bottom of the sea. 
The gamescreen was created on Canvas, with a width of 800 and 600 height.
The player and the obstacles are created with Objects. 
I used Html, Javasacript and CSS.
The player has three lifes and lost one everytime a trash touch the bottom of the sea.
The player needs to use just the arrow keys to move the turttle.
A Lettuce will give an extra life to the player. 
Squirtle evolve during the game, based on the player's pontuation.
The game difficult increase acoording the pontuation.
